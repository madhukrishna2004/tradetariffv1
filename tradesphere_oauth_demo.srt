This video demonstrates how our platform securely uses the Gmail API `gmail.send` scope.

5
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:23,000
Let’s walk through the real use case of how our users interact with the Gmail API.

6
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:28,000
The user logs into TradeSphere Global using their Google account on our secure dashboard.

7
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:34,000
Upon clicking the “Send Email Page” button, the user is redirected to the email composer screen.

8
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:39,000
Here, the user enters recipient email, subject, message body, and optionally attaches a file.

9
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:44,000
Once ready, they click “Send Email” to trigger the Gmail API authentication flow.

10
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:49,000
Google’s OAuth screen is shown, and the user selects their Gmail account to continue.

11
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:54,000
The consent screen appears, requesting the `gmail.send` permission only.

12
00:00:54,001 --> 00:01:00,000
After the user grants permission, the email is sent from their Gmail account using our system.

13
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:06,000
The user immediately sees a success confirmation inside our app dashboard.

14
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:11,000
To ensure transparency, the user can also check their Gmail "Sent" folder.

15
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:16,000
The email appears as if they sent it directly from their Gmail account.

16
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:21,000
Additionally, we log this email event inside the app’s “Sent Email” section.

17
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:26,000
No Gmail content is stored, and we never access or read user inboxes.

18
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:31,000
We only use `gmail.send` to send user-initiated messages with their full consent.

19
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:36,000
Tokens are encrypted and scoped per session. No token is stored persistently.

20
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:41,000
This implementation is fully compliant with Google’s API Services User Data Policy.

21
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:46,000
We respect user privacy, and no data is sold, shared, or used outside intended scope.

22
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:51,000
Our app ensures that users stay in control of what is sent from their account.

23
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you for reviewing the OAuth implementation of TradeSphere Global by KrisLynx LLP.
